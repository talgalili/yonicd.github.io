Thinking of creating a new package? Dread the task of function documentation? Afraid to run `devtools::check(build_args = '--as-cran')` and get bombarded by Errors, Warnings, and Notes (oh my!) ? Wait.... breathe!

After feeling all that anxiety and following all of Hadley's [directions](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) online, I felt I was doing a lot of manual labour, and that a package should be doing all lot of this for me. So we wrote one - Sinew (sin-yu).

Why Sinew? Let me explain by example... 

The current way to start on the documentation path is to create a function, so here is one that takes the first `h` values of a vector of length 10 drawn from the distribution `N(0,1)`. 

```r
myFun <- function(h=1){
  utils::head(rnorm(10),h)
}
```

Next I would use the skeleton provided by RStudio (see Code=>Insert Roxygen Skeleton).

```r
#' Title
#'
#' @param h 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
myFun <- function(h=1){
  utils::head(h)
}
```

This gets me on my way, but there is information nested within the function itself that can be useful to document and manage the namespace

  - the default value of `h`
  - the function `head` needs to be imported from the package `utils`
  
I could just add that manually but this is just a toy example, actual functions have many parameters and you can use many functions from a number of different packages. Trying to do the documentation book keeping as you develop the function will make you lose your train of thought, and make you forget that great idea you just had. Or you could write the full function and then at the end try to figure out what functions you need to import what packages they are from, should they get a seealso field, what parameters you used and so on...

Sinew will do this for you. It will parse your full function for relevant information that can fill in the blanks in the roxygen2 documentation and manage your import fields for you. 

Think of it as connecting the meat of your function to the Roxygen2 skeleton - or just the [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon) of the term sinew (again sin-yu). Added bonus it will help keep your package CRAN ready as you develop. 

So how would that skeleton look after running it with sinew?

```r
#' @title FUNCTION_TITLE
#' @description FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION
#' @param h PARAM_DESCRIPTION, Default: 1
#' @return OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION
#' @details DETAILS
#' @examples 
#' \dontrun{
#' if(interactive()){
#'  #EXAMPLE1
#'  }
#' }
#' @seealso 
#'  \code{\link[utils]{head}}
#' @rdname myFun
#' @export 
#' @importFrom utils head
myFun <- function(h=1){
  utils::head(h)
}
```

That little function had a lot of information embbeded in it to make your documentation well rounded.

  - Each field has it's own **placeholder** that will guide you to what is expected.
  - **parameter** has the default value built in.
  - **examples**  is populated with a more current layout to support htmlwidget and shiny examples. 
  - `utils` was found and was added to **importFrom** automatically as was it's **seealso** counterpart. 
  - **rdname** was added with the name of the function.
